Measure out how much food your chooks need. Chooks are designed to eat all day so it is important to make sure they have access to food all the time.

Feed your chickens at regular times each day. Chickens need to eat all day, so always have good quality feed in their pens. A good format to follow is to top their feed up in the mornings and let them out for 30-60 mins in the late afternoon. Usually they will go into their pen as night falls, or offer their scraps after their time out to encourage them back in.","Uuid":"525165562"}]},{"$Name":"HorizontalArrangement5","$Type":"HorizontalArrangement","$Version":"3","Width":"-2","Uuid":"928261114","$Components":[{"$Name":"Label5","$Type":"Label","$Version":"4","FontSize":"20","HasMargins":"False","Width":"-2","Text":"4.

Only feed chook products to chooks. A couple of important points about chook food that you should keep in mind. Firstly, the food for baby chickens is medicated to prevent a disease called coccidiosis. If you have laying hens eating the baby food as well, do not eat their eggs for 7 days after they have eaten it. Secondly, do not feed adult food to baby chickens. They need more nutrition to get them started in life and it causes deformaties and death. And thirdly do not allow other other animals to eat chicken food and do not feed chicken food to other animals.","Uuid":"-1704774631"}]},{"$Name":"HorizontalArrangement8","$Type":"HorizontalArrangement","$Version":"3","Width":"-2","Uuid":"1223535665","$Components":[{"$Name":"Button1","$Type":"Button","$Version":"6","Text":"Read more...","Uuid":"-1265451655"}]},{"$Name":"HorizontalArrangement9","$Type":"HorizontalArrangement","$Version":"3","AlignHorizontal":"2","Width":"-2","Uuid":"-743014366","$Components":[{"$Name":"Button2","$Type":"Button","$Version":"6","Height":"50","Width":"120","Image":"back_button1.png","Uuid":"1267191773"}]}]},{"$Name":"ActivityStarter1","$Type":"ActivityStarter","$Version":"6","Action":"android.intent.action.VIEW","DataUri":"http:\/\/www.citifarm.com.au\/a\/Chickens\/Feeding_tips_for_chickens","Uuid":"499221996"}]}}
