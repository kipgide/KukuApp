Use recycled materials whenever possible. \"Upcycling\" materials - making something better out of used materials - is a great way to build a coop on the cheap. But make sure that you don't use worn, rotting wood, or low-quality materials that will end up wearing out quickly. And sometimes the irregularities of a scavenged window or other item will be too hard to work around. If you're a beginner, this can add up to a lot of frustration quickly, so use upcycled or recycled materials thoughtfully.","Uuid":"-157264777"}]},{"$Name":"HorizontalArrangement7","$Type":"HorizontalArrangement","$Version":"3","Width":"-2","Uuid":"949023580","$Components":[{"$Name":"Label7","$Type":"Label","$Version":"4","FontSize":"20","HasMargins":"False","Width":"-2","Text":" 6.  Size your chicken coop properly.  If your birds will have access to an outdoor run, you'll want to allow for a minimum of 2-3 square feet per bird inside the coop, and aim for about 4 square feet per bird in the run. The higher you can go, the better, though. If your birds will be cooped all winter (chickens don't like to go out onto snowy surfaces), allow for 5-10 square feet per chicken. For birds that will be completely confined in a chicken tractor without an outdoor pen, give a minimum of 5 square feet per bird.  These are just general guidelines. The bigger the chicken, the more space it needs - so meat birds in general require more space than laying hens, and full-grown pullets need more space than baby chicks. Most annoying chicken problems like pecking and aggressiveness can be cured with more space, so plan for as generously-sized a coop as you can fit or afford.","Uuid":"-562637406"}]},{"$Name":"HorizontalArrangement8","$Type":"HorizontalArrangement","$Version":"3","Width":"-2","Uuid":"-452529660","$Components":[{"$Name":"Label8","$Type":"Label","$Version":"4","FontSize":"20","HasMargins":"False","Width":"-2","Text":" 7.  Give them plenty of roosting space. Chickens love to roost and will do so wherever given the chance - woodpiles, the tops of their waterers or feeders, the roof of their coop. So create roosting poles that are at least two to three feet off the ground (they don\u2019t like to be too low). Plan for at least six to ten inches of roosting space per chicken. If the roosting poles are more than four feet high, they will need a way to get up to them, like a piece of wood with strips across it for steps.

Decide whether the chicken coop should be movable or fixed in place.  A movable coop is going to be small and light. You can move the birds often to pasture them on fresh grass.
