Provide the correct feed: As basic as it sounds, chickens must be fed properly to perform optimally and to be healthy. Even though our great grandparents may have fed their flocks cracked corn or scratch, advances in science and the work of poultry nutritionists reveals that backyard chickens require much more nutritionally to live long, healthy lives, while producing nutritious eggs.

Excessive treats, even healthy ones, can cause any of the following: obesity, reduced egg production, malformed eggs, habitual laying of multiple-yolked eggs, vent prolapse, protein deficiencies, feather-picking, fatty liver syndrome, egg binding, reduced egg production, increased risk of heat stroke and heart problems. Ideally, no more than 5% of a flock's daily dietary intake should consist of treats.","Uuid":"-48396461"}]},{"$Name":"HorizontalArrangement5","$Type":"HorizontalArrangement","$Version":"3","Width":"-2","Uuid":"1407554663","$Components":[{"$Name":"Label5","$Type":"Label","$Version":"4","FontSize":"20","HasMargins":"False","Width":"-2","Text":"4.
